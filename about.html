            <p>Hi everyone, My name is Khai. I am a trained neuroscientist, who have extensive research experience in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. My Ph.D. thesis focused on dissecting various memory performances and how these related to brain shrinkage in patients with variants of Alzheimer's Disease.</p>

            <p>
            Check out one of my published papers <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00330/full" rel="self" target="_blank">[HERE]</a>.
            </p>

            

            <p>One of the things I am passion about in life (besides my two rescued beautiful english bulldogs) is how technology can improve and have a positive impact on society in the field of healthcare, education, and finances. That is one reason why I recently transitioned my career to the Artifical Intelligence (AI) space.</p>

            <p>I really enjoy learning new things and finding ways to update my knowledge. </p>
            
            <p>Because I was curious to learn more about various techniques used in AI, I joined Udacity Nanodegree program in Deep Learning, where I got to apply these advanced technology to real-world datasets.</p>

            <p>
            Check out my deep learning projects <a href="https://github.com/winkhai/deep_learning_projects" rel="self" target="_blank">[HERE]</a>.
            </p>

            <p> </br> Currently, I am apart of the Udacity Nanodegree program for Artifical Intelligence for trading. Coming from a strong healthcare background, I found these financial terms very intimidating at first. But once I got past various trading strategies term, I realized that the statistical analyses used in the financial world are similar to those used in medical sector. So for those of you starting out in a new field, don't be scared to get your feet wet. Learning new things, try new things, and enjoy the process. </p>
